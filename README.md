Phishing Email Detection and Classification
A machine learning-based project that detects and classifies emails as phishing or legitimate using NLP techniques. The dataset is preprocessed with tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Features are extracted using TF-IDF, and models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM are trained for classification. The system achieves high accuracy and can be integrated into email clients to enhance security.
